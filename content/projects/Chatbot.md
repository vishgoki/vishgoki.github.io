This project involved developing a chatbot trained on the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, leveraging PyTorch for an end-to-end NLP solution. The project covered data preprocessing, building a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with Luong attention. Greedy-search decoding was implemented to enhance chatbot interaction and model optimization.
