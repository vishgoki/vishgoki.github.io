[Neural Architecture Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search) for [Medical Image Segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) - Implemented NASSegNet for nuclei image segmentation with [analog/hardware-based](https://research.ibm.com/projects/analog-ai) neural architecture search (HW-NAS). Until now, only classification architectures have been implemented in this domain, so the unique value of this solution is the new segmentation implementation.
